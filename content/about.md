# PDH.Stat codelist explorer

This is a simple web application to explore the codelists used in the SPC PDH.Stat portal.
The application is built using the [marmite](https://rochacbruno.github.io/marmite/) framework, which is a light Rust static web site generator that is particularly well-suited for working in a scripted fashion and generating prototypes.

The application is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](https://pacificcommunity.github.io/pdh-dotstat-codelist_explorer/).

It should enable full text search on the codelists and display the codelist in a user-friendly way.
